#### 1. `shatakshi_shewale_evaluation.ipynb`

- Implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook
- Covers tasks such as:
  - Sequence data manipulation
  - Data cleaning
  - File parsing
  - Statistical summaries
  - Efficient coding practices


#### 2. `NGS_assessment.Rmd`

- A two-part bioinformatics technical assessment using **Seurat v5**:
  - **Part 1**: Human Bone Marrow single-cell RNA-seq analysis
    - Perform full Seurat pipeline (QC, normalization, PCA, UMAP, clustering, annotation)
    - Annotate 21 cell types using marker genes (Ensembl IDs)
  - **Part 2**: Human Pancreas single-cell RNA-seq analysis
    - Identify and annotate **PP cells** and **Alpha cells**
    - Perform sub-clustering to refine annotations
    - Identify new marker genes
- Implemented in R using Seurat v5.0.3.
- `NGS_Assessment results` folder includes all the all the results(dotplots, excel sheets, annotated .rds objects) and answers to the questioned asked
